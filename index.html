          <p> The charge port is located on the left side of Model 3, behind a door that is part of the rear tail light
            assembly. Before charging, park Model 3 to ensure that the charge cable easily reaches the charge port.
            With Model 3 unlocked (or an authenticated phone is within range) and in Park, press and release the button
            on the Tesla charge cable to open the charge port door.
          </p>
          <p>You can also open the charge port door using any of these methods: </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              On the touchscreen, use the app launcher to open the Charging app, then touch Open Charge Port.
            </li>
            <li>
              On the car status on the touchscreen, touch the charging icon.
            </li>
            <li>On the "Cards" area on the touchscreen, touch the charging icon, then press OPEN CHARGE PORT.
            </li>
            <li>Press the bottom of the charge port door when Model 3 is unlocked or an authenticated phone is nearby.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <code>CAUTION: Do not try to force the charge port door open.</code>

          <p> If desired, use the touchscreen to change the charge limit and the charging current.
            To charge at a public charging station, plug the appropriate adapter into the vehicle's charging port, and
            then connect the station's charging connector to the adapter. The most commonly used adapter(s) for each
            market region are provided. Depending on the charging equipment you are using, you may need to start and
            stop charging using a control on the charging equipment. </p>
          <p>If you are using the Mobile Connector, plug it into the power outlet before plugging it into Model 3.
            Align the connector to the charge port and insert fully. When the connector is properly inserted, charging
            begins automatically after Model 3:

          <p>
            During charging, the charge port light (the Tesla "T" logo) pulses green, and the touchscreen displays the
            charging status. The frequency at which the charge port light pulses slows down as the charge level
            approaches full. When charging is complete, the light stops pulsing and is solid green </p>
          <code>NOTE: If Model 3 is locked, the charge port light does not light up.</code>
          <p> If the charge port light turns red while charging, a fault is detected. Check the touchscreen for a
            message describing the fault. A fault can occur due to something as common as a power outage. If a power
            outage occurs, charging resumes automatically when power is restored.
          </p>
          <code>NOTE: When charging, particularly at high currents, the refrigerant compressor and fan operate as needed to keep the Battery cool. Therefore, it is normal to hear sounds during charging.<br><br>
NOTE: Air conditioning performance is generally not affected by charging. However, under certain circumstances (for example, you are charging at high currents during a particularly warm day), the air coming from the vents may not be as cool as expected and a message displays on the touchscreen. This is normal behavior and ensures that the Battery stays within an optimum temperature range while charging to support longevity and optimum performance.</code>

          <p> Stop charging at any time by disconnecting the charge cable or touching Stop Charging on the touchscreen.
          </p>
          <code>NOTE: To prevent unauthorized unplugging of the charge cable, the charge cable latch remains locked and Model 3 must be unlocked or able to recognize your authenticated phone before you can disconnect the charge cable. However, in cold ambient temperatures below 41째 F (5째 C), the charge port remains unlocked whenever the vehicle is not charging, even when Model 3 is locked.</code>
          <p> To disconnect the charge cable:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Press and hold the button on the connector handle to release the latch. Alternatively, unlock the
              vehicle by opening a door, using a key card or key fob, or touching Stop Charging on the touchscreen.
              These methods unlock the charge port as well.</li>
            <li>Pull the connector from the charge port.</li>

            not charging. In these situations, the charge port light is white.</p>
          <p>WHITE: The charge port door is open. Model 3 is ready to charge and the connector is not inserted, or the
            charge port latch is unlocked and the connector is ready to be removed. </p>
